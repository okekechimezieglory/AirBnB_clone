web static

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything
During this project, I will manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of the page, the design.
